CMake Warning (dev) at D:/c++/CLion 2022.1.3/bin/cmake/win/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (Boost) does
  not match the name of the calling package (BOOST).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  D:/c++/CLion 2022.1.3/bin/cmake/win/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindBoost.cmake:2375 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
